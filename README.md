I was looking for a way to showcase my skills using SQL Server, SSMS and Telerik Report Designer.  As luck would have it, I was also starting to make and sell leather and gemstone beaded bracelets.  I created this database to keep track of supplies and costs as well as a Crosstab Report to track bracelet inventory.


Here is my Bracelet Database Diagram with Foreign Key Relationships.
